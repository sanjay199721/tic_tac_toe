# tic_tac_toe
Implement tic tac toe along with a bot

Tried out vanilla q learning and deep q learning methods. Both of them turned out to be inefficient at trying out all actions and states.

Finally chose "minimax method" which is finding the optimum action from an agent , by exploring  all actions played by two agents where one is trying to maximize their score and the other trying to minimize theirs.
